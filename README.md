# Students Assignments Grades
Student Assignment Grades is a script that evaluate each students' assignment grade and average grade in course.

# Project Description
The input information presented as data types:

- A **CourseInfo** object, which looks like this:
`
{
  "id": number,
  "name": string,
}
`
- An **AssignmentGroup** object, which looks like this:

`{
  "id": number,
  "name": string,
  // the ID of the course the assignment group belongs to
  "course_id": number,
  // the percentage weight of the entire assignment group
  "group_weight": number,
  "assignments": [AssignmentInfo],
}`

- Each **AssignmentInfo** object within the assignments array looks like this

`{
  "id": number,
  "name": string,
  // the due date for the assignment
  "due_at": Date string,
  // the maximum points possible for the assignment
  "points_possible": number,
}
`

- An array of **LearnerSubmission** objects, which each look like this:

`
{
    "learner_id": number,
    "assignment_id": number,
    "submission": {
      "submitted_at": Date string,
      "score": number
    }
}
`

The **Output** of the script should be represented as:

`
{
    // the ID of the learner for which this data has been collected
    "id": number,
    // the learnerâ€™s total, weighted average, in which assignments
    // with more points_possible should be counted for more
    // e.g. a learner with 50/100 on one assignment and 190/200 on another
    // would have a weighted average score of 240/300 = 80%.
    "avg": number,
    // each assignment should have a key with its ID,
    // and the value associated with it should be the percentage that
    // the learner scored on the assignment (submission.score / points_possible)
    <assignment_id>: number,
    // if an assignment is not yet due, it should not be included in either
    // the average or the keyed dictionary of scores
}
`
Project main functions:
1. **getLearnerData( CourseInfo, AssignmentGroup, [LearnerSubmission] ) ** - main function. 
input parameters:
- CourseInfo
- AssignmentGroup
- Array of LearnerSubmission
output:
array of student objects

2. **getLearner(learners, learner_id)** - additional function. Provide the student object for which the assignment score would be calculated.  Function checked if in learners array we have information about the scores for student with id = "learner_id" then returns this student object. If we wanted to calculate score for new student, that function declate the student object, add it to learners array and return it.
input parameters:
- learners - array of all students in course which has any kind of scores
- learner_id - the id of student
output: 
student object that exists in learners

3. **calculateAssignmentScore(student, assignmentInfo, learnerSubmition)** - additional function. Function calculates the assignment score.
input parameters:
- student - student object in which we will add information about the assignment score
- assignmentInfo - AssignmentInfo object 
- learnerSubmission -  LearnerSubmission.submission property information

4. **calculateAverageScore(studentsScores)** - additional function. Calculates average scores for all students who submitted any assignmnents
input parameters:
- studentScores - array of students objects

5. **deleteAdditionalProperties(dataArray, ...properties)** - additional function. Function that delete any properlies from the object
input parameters:
- dataArray - array of objects. We want to delete properties from every object in array
- properties - array of property's names
